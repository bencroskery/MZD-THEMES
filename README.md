# MZD-THEMES
Themes for Mazda Connect systems.

Use MZD-AIO-TI to install these themes with the following tweaks:
- Background Image: Pick "Single Img" and find the _background.png_
- Custom Infotainment Colors: Pick "Custom Theme" and select the _jci_ folder

IMPORTANT: After creating the _copy_to_usb_ folder, paste the theme _jci_ folder over top of _copy_to_usb/config/jci_ to copy over extra theme files MZD-AIO-TI does not copy, otherwise the theme will not look right in your car.
